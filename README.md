This repository contains a comprehensive study on social network analysis (SNA) using Python and the NetworkX library. Developed as part of the CSCI 5V75 Special Topics course at the University of Central Arkansas, this project explores how information flows through networks and how graph theory can be used to analyze relationships in digital and real-world social structures.

ðŸ“˜ Key Topics Covered:
Graph representation of social networks

Types of social networks: Small-World, Scale-Free, Random, and Homophilic

Centrality measures: Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, and PageRank

Clustering based on centrality

Information diffusion models: Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade

ðŸ§ª Datasets:
Game of Thrones character interaction network

Facebook combined dataset from SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project)
